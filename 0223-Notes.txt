Moving hard to publish this week
But threw myself a new hook by changing the way the LumiaOlt object tracks ONU
I needed to combine the SN, Intf and Attached Profile logic
This was not available in the existing data model
So I made a new object, the Register, and a Registry [] object
This is an optimized cache that holds the provisioning info
And can be updated from a file while only performing Gets to see what the OLT currently believes

Unfortunately I was making good progress towards completion of my demos
But I saved my state before moving forward in a zip, and built the working demos
It shouldn't be much more cleanup, but its a mess right now
