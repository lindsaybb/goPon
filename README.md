Golang-based API Tutorials for the Iskratel Passive Optical Network (PON aka Fiber-to-the-Home) products.

This is a client-side library that depends on connection to the GPON or XGS-PON OLT from Iskratel to complete. At this stage in the project, this repository is being made public to showcase some of the core functionality possible with this API related to essential Service Provider maintenance of the system. Any code reviews or related comments would be appreciated. The only external dependency is for the FTP interactions, which I didn't see any benefit of redoing, although the source is not actively maintained the interaction suits the basic need. This application would benefit from a user interface, from a back-end database, and from many more examples and expanded configuration. However, I have put a year of work into learning how to demonstrate this code efficiently, and hope that the basic goal is well communicated. The first video demonstrating some core functionality of the system has been posted at the YouTube link below.
